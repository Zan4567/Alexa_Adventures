# Alexa Adventures

## Description

Alexa Adventures is a series of narrative adventure games controlled by voice commands from the user, using Amazon Echo's Alexa API. Repair a spaceship, hear what Alexa has been keeping secret, or engage in casual small-talk with a super-intelligent AI, all with a few utterances and from the comfort of your own living room. An update to the classic choose-your-own-adventure, Alexa Adventures aims to supply a unique user experience.

#### How to play Alexa Adventures:
1. Ensure that your Amazon Echo is plugged in and connected to wifi.
2. To start Alexa Adventures, simply say, **"Alexa, take me on an adventure."**
3. Alexa will then bring up the Main Menu for Alexa Adventures. At this point she will list the available adventures for you to choose from. To start a particular adventure, **say the name of the adventure.**
4. Once you've started your adventure, Alexa will give you prompts; and you, the adventurer, will make choices accordingly using voice commands.*

Be aware that certain choices you make have the potential to end the current adventure. If this occurs, Alexa will notify you, bring you back to the Main Menu, and from there you have the option to play again or exit Alexa Adventures.

*_Note: The voice commands you're allowed to give Alexa vary based upon the adventure, so be sure to listen to the opening prompt when you first begin your adventure._
